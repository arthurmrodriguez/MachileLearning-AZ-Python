This **Machine Learning** complete guide is being written while following a Machine Learning course from **Udemy**, offered by **SuperDataScience**. This guide will contain all the information acquired during the course and is here presented to serve as a knowledge data base for future uses.

This course is offered using **Python** and **R** programming languages, but I chose to focus on Python knowledge, so it will be the only language shown in here as well as in source code.
	
Every directory will contain a `.md` file with the information regarding every section of the course, with all its knowledge, from mathematical, to statistical and, of course, programming.
